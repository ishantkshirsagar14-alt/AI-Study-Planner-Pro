## 🧠 AI & ML Logic Used

### 1️⃣ Weighted Study Allocation
Subjects are assigned weights:
- Weak → 3
- Medium → 2
- Strong → 1

Time is distributed using:

Allocated Hours = (Weight / Total Weight) × Total Study Hours

---

### 2️⃣ Performance Prediction (Machine Learning)

A Linear Regression model is used to predict expected performance based on:
- Study Hours
- Days Remaining
- Average Subject Difficulty

Library Used:
- Scikit-learn
